# Physics_Wallah_Task
I have used Java as the programming language. I am equally proficient in Kotlin as well but it has been a while since I used it so preffered using Java for the task.

To handle the long list of qualification I have made the whole section scrollable as it gives a neat effect to the screen. Using volley for api call and GSON package for conversion of JSON Object to class. Other than that I have used Glide for image loading.
